# PerformanceReport_PowerBI
Hello there!

I am thrilled to share my latest Analytics Project - Performance Report. 
Using Power BI, I transformed an excel sheet data into a condensed dynamic Performance Report that utilizes Switch Measure and conditional formatting to better understand the details that can help them take a data-driven decision efficiently and effectively.

Key Features that I have included in my project are:-

ðŸ“ŠInteractive Dashboards: I have created 4 Interactive dashboards on this Performance report project that aiming to add value with each report. Easily track and analyze sales, quantities and gross profits in real-time, with visualizations that make complex data easy to understand.
 
ðŸ”„Switch Measure: Seamlessly switch between different views and metrics to focus on what sparks your interest - Sales Numbers, Quantity sold or Gross Profit. 
 
ðŸŒŸInteractive Elements: Drill down into specific product lines, countries, and time periods with just a few clicks, to better understand the trends. 
 
ðŸ“ˆ Performance Insights: Gain valuable insights into the performance of Plant Co. with data visualizations that highlight key trends and patterns.
